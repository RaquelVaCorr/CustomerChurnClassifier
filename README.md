Shared files
● train.csv: the training dataset. Churn is the binary target to predict.
Note: Use this database to train and fine-tune the algorithm(s) that you choose. Also,
use this dataset to evaluate your trained model and create a performance report.
● inference.csv - the inference dataset. Use this database in order to predict if the
registers will be a Churn (1) or not (0).
Note: this file doesn’t have the target column. It is going to be used for the prediction
stage and evaluate your solution.
